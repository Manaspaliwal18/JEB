💎 Jewel e Bazaar (JEB)

Jewel e Bazaar (JEB) is a jewelry discovery and trust platform built to modernize how customers discover, compare, and choose jewelry stores — using transparent reviews and reputation instead of ads or middlemen.

Jewelry is one of the most trust-sensitive and high-value consumer purchases. JEB is designed to bring clarity, confidence, and digital trust into an otherwise fragmented offline market.

## 🧠 Problem

India’s jewelry market operates largely offline and suffers from a discovery and trust gap:

- Customers struggle to compare local jewelers objectively
- Trust depends heavily on word-of-mouth
- Reviews are scattered, informal, or unreliable
- Offline comparison requires significant time and effort
- Genuine jewelers lack structured digital visibility

This results in **decision fatigue for buyers** and **limited growth for credible jewelers**.

## ✅ Solution: Jewel e Bazaar

Jewel e Bazaar functions as a **neutral trust and discovery layer** between customers and jewelry businesses.

### For Customers
- Discover jewelry stores and brands by location
- Compare jewelers based on real customer reviews
- Shortlist trusted stores before visiting showrooms
- Make informed decisions for high-value purchases

### For Jewelers
- Build a verified digital presence
- Earn trust through transparent customer feedback
- Compete on credibility, not paid promotion
- Reach customers beyond walk-in footfall

JEB prioritizes **reputation over advertising**.
